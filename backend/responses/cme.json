Its source is a prominent eruption of a long filament off the southwest limb seen in SDO AIA 304/193/171 imagery, as well as in EUVI A 195/304 imagery. The filament appears to be potentially wrapping around the limb in both SOHO and STEREO A instruments, so it is hard to estimate the center of this erupting filament. It looks like the filament breaks up in two parts, one seen almost off the west limb in EUVI A 304, and the other part likely having a lower longitude.","submissionTime":"2025-06-30T17:34Z","versionId":4,"link":"https://webtools.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CME/39839/-1","cmeAnalyses":[{"isMostAccurate":true,"time21_5":"2025-06-30T01:01Z","latitude":-3.0,"longitude":141.0,"halfAngle":35.0,"speed":504.0,"type":"C","featureCode":"LE","imageType":"running difference","measurementTechnique":"SWPC_CAT","note":"Approximate analysis mostly based on the fit with three coronagraphs, but also taking into account that the filament is likely erupting from behind the west limb as seen in SDO AIA.","levelOfData":0,"tilt":null,"minorHalfWidth":null,"speedMeasuredAtHeight":null,"submissionTime":"2025-06-30T10:54Z","link":"https://webtools.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CMEAnalysis/39840/-1","enlilList":[{"modelCompletionTime":"2025-06-29T23:46Z","au":2.0,"estimatedShockArrivalTime":null,"estimatedDuration":null,"rmin_re":null,"kp_18":null,"kp_90":null,"kp_135":null,"kp_180":null,"isEarthGB":false,"link":"https://webtools.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/WSA-ENLIL/39841/-1","impactList":[{"isGlancingBlow":true,"isMinorImpact":false,"location":"Solar Orbiter","arrivalTime":"2025-07-02T12:00Z"}],"cmeIDs":["2025-06-29T11:36:00-CME-001","2025-06-29T15:36:00-CME-001"]}]}],"linkedEvents":null,"sentNotifications":[{"messageID":"20250630-AL-001","messageIssueTime":"2025-06-30T00:43Z","messageURL":"https://webtools.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/Alert/39842/1"}]},{"activityID":"2025-06-29T17:24:00-CME-001","catalog":"M2M_CATALOG","startTime":"2025-06-29T17:24Z","instruments":[{"displayName":"SOHO: LASCO/C2"},{"displayName":"SOHO: LASCO/C3"},{"displayName":"STEREO A: SECCHI/COR2"},{"displayName":"GOES: CCOR-1"}],"sourceLocation":"","activeRegionNum":null,"note":"A bright CME seen to the west in all three coronagraphs, which closely follows the 2025-06-29T15:36Z CME and is significantly narrower than this preceding CME.
