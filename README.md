# NASA Dashboard App

A dynamic web app built with **React** (frontend) and **Node.js** (backend), both using **TypeScript**.  
The app fetches data from NASA's public APIs and displays it through an interactive dashboard using **Syncfusion** components.  
It also integrates **OpenAI** for translating content and generating interactive quizzes based on NASA data.
